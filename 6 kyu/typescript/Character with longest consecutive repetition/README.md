## Description

For a given string `s` find the character `c` (or `C`) with longest consecutive repetition and return:

```plaintext
[c, l]: [string, number]
```

where `l` (or `L`) is the length of the repetition. If there are two or more characters with the same l return the first in order of appearance.

For empty string return:

```plaintext
["", 0]
```

Happy coding! :)
